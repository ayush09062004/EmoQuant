# EmoQuant
Quantitative Emotion and Sentiment Analysis for Teletherapy 

# Problem Statement
### EmoQuant Overview

EmoQuant enhances Teletherapy by offering quantitative emotion and sentiment analysis tools. It analyzes video recordings of therapy sessions using OpenCV for face detection and deep learning models (AffectNet & FER-2013) for emotion recognition. Audio is also analyzed via Speech-to-Text API and sentiment analysis tools. The system provides therapists with a detailed dashboard of patient emotional trends, enabling data-driven, personalized care. By quantifying emotions, EmoQuant helps in tracking progress, tailoring interventions, early detection of issues, and advancing mental health research.
